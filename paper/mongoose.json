  {"id":"adamiEvolutionaryGame2016","abstract":"Evolutionary game theory is a successful mathematical framework geared towards understanding the selective pressures that affect the evolution of the strategies of agents engaged in interactions with potential conflicts. While a mathematical treatment of the costs and benefits of decisions can predict the optimal strategy in simple settings, more realistic settings such as finite populations, non-vanishing mutations rates, stochastic decisions, communication between agents, and spatial interactions, require agent-based methods where each agent is modeled as an individual, carries its own genes that determine its decisions, and where the evolutionary outcome can only be ascertained by evolving the population of agents forward in time. While highlighting standard mathematical results, we compare those to agent-based methods that can go beyond the limitations of equations and simulate the complexity of heterogeneous populations and an ever-changing set of interactors. We conclude that agent-based methods can predict evolutionary outcomes where purely mathematical treatments cannot tread (for example in the weak selection–strong mutation limit), but that mathematics is crucial to validate the computational simulations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Adami","given":"Christoph"},{"family":"Schossau","given":"Jory"},{"family":"Hintze","given":"Arend"}],"container-title":"Physics of Life Reviews","container-title-short":"Physics of Life Reviews","DOI":"10.1016/j.plrev.2016.08.015","ISSN":"1571-0645","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1-26","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Evolutionary game theory using agent-based methods","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1571064516300884","volume":"19"},
  {"id":"barkerWithingroupCompetition2012","abstract":"Social organisms in many taxa cooperate to produce resources that are shared among group members. Some cooperatively produced resources may be monopolized by individuals who invest in within-group competition, but these have largely been overlooked in empirical and theoretical research on human cooperation, which has focused on noncontestable public goods. In this study, we allow for the potential of within-group competition over cooperatively produced resources and use a game theoretic “tug-of-war” model and empirical test to show that such competition decreases the degree of cooperation within human groups and hence decreases group members' payoffs. Our study thus sheds light on how cooperative production and equal division of shared resources may have evolved, expands on current models of human cooperation to reflect the many natural conditions with opportunities for within-group competition, and demonstrates unifying principles in cooperation and competition across the animal kingdom.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Barker","given":"Jessica L."},{"family":"Barclay","given":"Pat"},{"family":"Reeve","given":"H.

We use a standard extended fitness accounting framework to identify the parameter space for which this co-evolutionary process generates high levels of group-beneficial behaviors. We show that intergroup conflicts may explain the evolutionary success of both: (a) altruistic forms of human sociality towards unrelated members of one's group; and (b) group-level institutional structures such as food sharing which have emerged and diffused repeatedly in a wide variety of ecologies during the course of human history. Group-beneficial behaviors may evolve if (a) they inflict sufficient fitness costs on outgroup individuals and (b) group-level institutions limit the individual fitness costs of these behaviors and thereby attenuate within-group selection against these behaviors. Thus, the evolutionary success of individually costly but group-beneficial behaviors in the relevant environments during the first 90,000 years of anatomically modern human existence may have been a consequence of distinctive human capacities in social institution building.","author":[{"family":"Bowles","given":"Samuel"},{"family":"Choi","given":"Jung-Kyoo"},{"family":"Hopfensitz","given":"Astrid"}],"container-title":"Journal of Theoretical Biology","container-title-short":"J.

Although such “altruistic punishment” may explain the high levels of cooperation in human societies, it creates an evolutionary puzzle: existing models suggest that altruistic cooperation among nonrelatives is evolutionarily stable only in small groups. Thus, applying such models to the evolution of altruistic punishment leads to the prediction that people will not incur costs to punish others to provide benefits to large groups of nonrelatives. However, here we show that an important asymmetry between altruistic cooperation and altruistic punishment allows altruistic punishment to evolve in populations engaged in one-time, anonymous interactions. This process allows both altruistic punishment and altruistic cooperation to be maintained even when groups are large and other parameter values approximate conditions that characterize cultural evolution in the small-scale societies in which humans lived for most of our prehistory.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Boyd","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Gintis","given":"Herbert"},{"family":"Bowles","given":"Samuel"},{"family":"Richerson","given":"Peter J."}],"container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"PNAS","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.0630443100","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2003,3,18]]},"language":"en","page":"3531-3535","PMID":"12631700","publisher":"National Academy of Sciences","section":"Social Sciences","source":"www.pnas.org","title":"The evolution of altruistic punishment","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/content/100/6/3531","volume":"100"},

For example, the accumulation of nutrients, provision of shade, amelioration of disturbance, or protection from herbivores by some species can enhance the performance of neighbouring species. Thus the notion that the distributions and abundances of plant species are independent of other species may be inadequate as a theoretical underpinning for understanding species coexistence and diversity2. But there have been no large-scale experiments designed to examine the generality of positive interactions in plant communities and their importance relative to competition. Here we show that the biomass, growth and reproduction of alpine plant species are higher when other plants are nearby. In an experiment conducted in subalpine and alpine plant communities with 115 species in 11 different mountain ranges, we find that competition generally, but not exclusively, dominates interactions at lower elevations where conditions are less physically stressful. In contrast, at high elevations where abiotic stress is high the interactions among plants are predominantly positive. Furthermore, across all high and low sites positive interactions are more important at sites with low temperatures in the early summer, but competition prevails at warmer sites.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Callaway","given":"Ragan M."},{"family":"Brooker","given":"R.

In such cases of endogenously created carrying-capacity stress, intergroup relations are more likely to become negatively interdependent, and parochial competition can emerge as a response.

  {"id":"dedreuIngroupDefense2016","abstract":"Intergroup conflict persists when and because individuals make costly contributions to their group's fighting capacity, but how groups organize contributions into effective collective action remains poorly understood. Here we distinguish between contributions aimed at subordinating out-groups (out-group aggression) from those aimed at defending the in-group against possible out-group aggression (in-group defense). We conducted two experiments in which three-person aggressor groups confronted three-person defender groups in a multiround contest game (n = 276; 92 aggressor-defender contests). Individuals received an endowment from which they could contribute to their group's fighting capacity. Contributions were always wasted, but when the aggressor group's fighting capacity exceeded that of the defender group, the aggressor group acquired the defender group's remaining resources (otherwise, individuals on both sides were left with the remainders of their endowment). In-group defense appeared stronger and better coordinated than out-group aggression, and defender groups survived roughly 70% of the attacks. This low success rate for aggressor groups mirrored that of group-hunting predators such as wolves and chimpanzees (n = 1,382 cases), hostile takeovers in industry (n = 1,637 cases), and interstate conflicts (n = 2,586). Furthermore, whereas peer punishment increased out-group aggression more than in-group defense without affecting success rates (Exp. 1), sequential (vs. simultaneous) decision-making increased coordination of collective action for out-group aggression, doubling the aggressor's success rate (Exp. 2). The relatively high success rate of in-group defense suggests evolutionary and cultural pressures may have favored capacities for cooperation and coordination when the group goal is to defend, rather than to expand, dominate, and exploit.","author":[{"family":"De Dreu","given":"Carsten K.

  {"id":"ewenImprovingSupplementary2015","abstract":"Supplementary feeding is often a knee-jerk reaction to population declines, and its application is not critically evaluated, leading to polarized views among managers on its usefulness. Here, we advocate a more strategic approach to supplementary feeding so that the choice to use it is clearly justified over, or in combination with, other management actions and the predicted consequences are then critically assessed following implementation. We propose combining methods from a set of specialist disciplines that will allow critical evaluation of the need, benefit, and risks of food supplementation. Through the use of nutritional ecology, population ecology, and structured decision making, conservation managers can make better choices about what and how to feed by estimating consequences on population recovery across a range of possible actions. This structured approach also informs targeted monitoring and more clearly allows supplementary feeding to be integrated in recovery plans and reduces the risk of inefficient decisions. In New Zealand, managers of the endangered Hihi (Notiomystis cincta) often rely on supplementary feeding to support reintroduced populations. On Kapiti island the reintroduced Hihi population has responded well to food supplementation, but the logistics of providing an increasing demand recently outstretched management capacity. To decide whether and how the feeding regime should be revised, managers used a structured decision making approach informed by population responses to alternative feeding regimes. The decision was made to reduce the spatial distribution of feeders and invest saved time in increasing volume of food delivered into a smaller core area. The approach used allowed a transparent and defendable management decision in regard to supplementary feeding, reflecting the multiple objectives of managers and their priorities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Ewen","given":"John G"},{"family":"Walker","given":"Leila"},{"family":"Canessa","given":"Stefano"},{"family":"Groombridge","given":"Jim J"}],"container-title":"Conservation Biology","container-title-short":"Conserv Biol","DOI":"10.1111/cobi.12410","ISSN":"0888-8892","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,4]]},"page":"341-349","PMCID":"PMC4405093","PMID":"25354808","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Improving supplementary feeding in species conservation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4405093/","volume":"29"},

We show that in a patch‐structured population, when there is a marked sex bias in dispersal, selection will almost always favor harming behavior among individuals of the sex more prone to dispersal. This result holds regardless of the effects of mating skew or overlapping generations. Selection may well also favor helping behavior among individuals of the philopatric sex, particularly if there is generational overlap, but this is less likely to occur if individuals of the philopatric sex compete more intensely for fewer breeding opportunities. In this last case, if generational overlap is low and mating skew pronounced, the result may be selection for harming behavior among both males and females. In general, the rate of dispersal and the level of relatedness among individuals of one sex do not reliably predict their level of helping or harming behavior; selection on either males or females depends on the dispersal of both sexes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Johnstone","given":"Rufus A."},{"family":"Cant","given":"Michael A."}],"container-title":"The American Naturalist","container-title-short":"The American Naturalist","DOI":"10.1086/589899","ISSN":"0003-0147","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008,9,1]]},"page":"318-330","source":"journals.uchicago.edu (Atypon)","title":"Sex Differences in Dispersal and the Evolution of Helping and Harming.","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/589899","volume":"172"},

  {"id":"koenigEvolutionDelayed1992","abstract":"Why do the young of cooperative breeders-species in which more than two individuals help raise offspring at a single nest-delay dispersal and live in groups? Answering this deceptively simple question involves examining the costs and benefits of three alternative strategies: (1) dispersal and attempting to breed, (2) dispersal and floating, and (3) delayed dispersal and helping. If, all other things being equal, the fitness of individuals that delay dispersal is greater than the fitness of individuals that disperse and freed on their own, intrinsic benefits are paramount to the current maintenance of delayed dispersal. Intrinsic benefits are directly due to living with others and may include enhanced foraging efficienty and redudec susceptibility to predation. However, if individuals that disperse and attempt to breed in high-quality habitat achieve the highest fitness, extrinsic constraints on the ability of offspring to obtain such high-quality breeding opportunities force offspring to either delay dispersal or float. The relevant constraint to independent reproduction has frequently been termed habitat saturation. This concept, of itself, fails to explain the evolution of delayed dispersal. Instead, we propose the delayed-dispersal threshold model as a guide for organizing and evaluating the ecological factors potentially responsible for this phenomenon. We identify five parameters critical to the probability of delayed dispersal: relative population desnity, the fitness differential between early dispersal/breeding and delayed dispersal, the observed or hypothetical fitness of floaters, the distribution of territory quality, and spatiotemporal environmental variability. A key conclusion from the model is that no one factor by itself causes delayed dispersal and cooperative breeding. However, a difference in the dispersal patterns between two closely related species or populations (or between individuals in the same population in different years) may be attributable to one or a small set of factors. Much remains to be done to pinpoint the relative importance of different ecological factors in promoting delayed dispersal. This is underscored by our current inability to explain satisfactory several patterns including the relative significance of flooting, geographic biases in the incidence of cooperative breeding, sexual asymmetries in delayed dispersal, the relationship between delayed dispersal leading to helping behavior and cooperative polygamy, and the rarity of the co-occurrence of helpers and floaters within the same population. Advances in this field remain to be made along several fronts. In particular, we advocate experimental tests of specific ecological factors affecting the parameters of the delayed-dispersal threshold model, studies of noncooperatively breeding taxa focusing on what constraints to independent reproduction exist and why they do not result in delayed dispersal, and studies of intraspecific variation in group size and composition of cooperative breeders in relation to local habitat gradients and patchiness.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,19]]},"archive":"JSTOR","author":[{"family":"Koenig","given":"Walter D."},{"family":"Pitelka","given":"Frank A."},{"family":"Carmen","given":"William J."},{"family":"Mumme","given":"Ronald L."},{"family":"Stanback","given":"Mark T."}],"container-title":"The Quarterly Review of Biology","ISSN":"0033-5770","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[1992]]},"page":"111-150","publisher":"University of Chicago Press","source":"JSTOR","title":"The Evolution of Delayed Dispersal in Cooperative Breeders","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/2831435","volume":"67"},

It occurs in invertebrates and vertebrates, and is prevalent in humans. What are the conditions under which coalitional aggression evolves in natural populations? In this article, I develop a mathematical model delineating conditions where natural selection can favor the coevolution of belligerence and bravery between small-scale societies. Belligerence increases an actor's group probability of trying to conquer another group and bravery increase the actors's group probability of defeating an attacked group. The model takes into account two different types of demographic scenarios that may lead to the coevolution of belligerence and bravery. Under the first, the fitness benefits driving the coevolution of belligerence and bravery come through the repopulation of defeated groups by fission of victorious ones. Under the second demographic scenario, the fitness benefits come through a temporary increase in the local carrying capacity of victorious groups, after transfer of resources from defeated groups to victorious ones. The analysis of the model suggests that the selective pressures on belligerence and bravery are stronger when defeated groups can be repopulated by victorious ones. The analysis also suggests that, depending on the shape of the contest success function, costly bravery can evolve in groups of any size.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Lehmann","given":"Laurent"}],"container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0021437","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,7,5]]},"language":"en","page":"e21437","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"The Demographic Benefits of Belligerence and Bravery: Defeated Group Repopulation or Victorious Group Size Expansion?","title-short":"The Demographic Benefits of Belligerence and Bravery","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0021437","volume":"6"},

We show that the selective pressure on these two traits can be substantial even in groups of large size, and that they may be driven by two independent reproduction-enhancing resources: additional mates for males and additional territory (or material resources) for females.

The origins of such variability are not known but recent work highlights that variations in environmental harshness may play a key role. A growing body of experimental work in evolutionary psychology suggests that humans adapt to their specific environment by calibrating their life-history strategy. In this paper, we apply structural equation models to test the association between current and childhood environmental harshness, life-history strategy and adult cooperation in two large-scale datasets (the World Values Survey and the European Values Study). The present study replicates existing research linking a harsher environment (both in adulthood and in childhood) with a modulated reproduction-maintenance trade-off and extends these findings to the domain of collective actions. Specifically, we find that a harsher environment (both in adulthood and in childhood) is associated with decreased involvement in collective action and that this association is mediated by individuals’ life-history strategy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Lettinga","given":"N."},{"family":"Jacquet","given":"P.

  {"id":"linlinyuhengResolvingParadox2019","abstract":"Cooperatively breeding animals occur in virtually every ecosystem on earth. Comparative and biogeographic studies suggest that both benign and harsh—as well as stable and ﬂuctuating—environments can favor the evolution of cooperative breeding behavior. The fact that cooperative societies occur in environments of such contrasting quality creates a paradox of environmental quality and sociality. The dual beneﬁts framework—which leads to the prediction that the ecological consequences of sociality (e.g., range size) vary depending on the beneﬁts that individuals of each species receive by forming social groups—offers a potential resolution to this paradox. Here we use a case study of two avian lineages, starlings (Sturnidae) and hornbills (Bucerotidae), in which environmental unpredictability appears to have opposite effects on the evolution of cooperation to test the dual beneﬁts framework. Consistent with previous work, harsh and unpredictable environments promote cooperative breeding behavior in starlings, which in turn leads to larger geographic ranges. However, cooperatively breeding hornbills occur in benign and stable environments, but sociality does not inﬂuence range size. Our study suggests that the paradox of environmental quality and sociality arises largely because cooperative breeding is an umbrella term encompassing social species that form groups for different reasons. We demonstrate that differentiating among the functional causes of social group formation is critical for developing a predictive framework for understanding the evolution of cooperative breeding behavior.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Lin (林宇恆)","given":"Yu-Heng"},{"family":"Chan (詹仕凡)","given":"Shih-Fan"},{"family":"Rubenstein","given":"Dustin R."},{"family":"Liu (劉彥廷)","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Shen (沈聖峰)","given":"Sheng-Feng"}],"container-title":"The American Naturalist","container-title-short":"The American Naturalist","DOI":"10.1086/704090","ISSN":"0003-0147, 1537-5323","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,8]]},"language":"en","page":"207-216","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Resolving the Paradox of Environmental Quality and Sociality: The Ecological Causes and Consequences of Cooperative Breeding in Two Lineages of Birds","title-short":"Resolving the Paradox of Environmental Quality and Sociality","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/704090","volume":"194"},

Understanding these events is complicated because the Kahama community had recently formed by fissioning from the Kasekela group and members of both communities had been provisioned with food.

Such resources benefit wildlife by providing reliable resources during periods of food shortages, but may also alter the risk of pathogen transmission and development of disease. While several reviews have summarized the detrimental effects of supplemental food on infection risk, we conducted a comprehensive review to quantify support for mechanisms by which intentional wildlife feeding influences host condition (i.e. malnutrition and stress) and pathogen transmission on a global scale and provide a framework to mitigate these risks. We also examined whether the purpose of feeding, whether for game management, conservation, tourism, or in residential areas, influenced health outcomes. We found 115 studies that evaluated the health of wildlife with supplementary feeding, representing 68 species in 35 countries, although nearly half (46% of studies) were from North America. Supplemental feeding tended to increase the risk of pathogen transmission by increasing contact rates between hosts (95%) and promoting pathogen accumulation at feeders or the surrounding environment (77%). Provisioned food was also often a source of immunosuppressive contaminants (80%). Feeding associated with tourism frequently increased wildlife stress, rates of injury, pathogen prevalence, or malnutrition (85%), while feeding for conservation purposes had mostly positive effects on wildlife health (63%). We recommend adopting feeding practices that validate the nutritional appropriateness of wildlife feed for the target species, make food available at lower densities for short periods at unpredictable times and places to prevent aggregation, and avoid feeding during times of migration, pulses of new recruits, and epidemics. These strategies will help retain the recreational and management benefits of wildlife provisioning while mitigating negative effects for many species around the world.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Murray","given":"Maureen H."},{"family":"Becker","given":"Daniel J."},{"family":"Hall","given":"Richard J."},{"family":"Hernandez","given":"Sonia M."}],"container-title":"Biological Conservation","container-title-short":"Biological Conservation","DOI":"10.1016/j.biocon.2016.10.034","ISSN":"0006-3207","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"163-174","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Wildlife health and supplemental feeding: A review and management recommendations","title-short":"Wildlife health and supplemental feeding","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320716306851","volume":"204"},
  {"id":"oroTestingGoodness2008","abstract":"Background Human-predator conflicts are directly or indirectly threatening many species with extinction. Thus, biologists are urged to find simple solutions to complex situations while avoiding unforeseen conservation outcomes. The provision of supplementary food at artificial feeding sites (AFS) is frequently used in the conservation of scavenger bird populations currently suffering from indirect poisoning, although no scientific studies on its effectiveness have been conducted. Methodology/Principal Findings We used a long-term data set of 95 individually marked birds from the largest European core of the endangered bearded vulture (Gypaetus barbatus) to test the long-term effects of specific AFS for bearded vultures on their survival rates (by CMR models) and population dynamics (by Monte Carlo simulations) in an area where fatalities derived from illegal poisoning and the use of other toxics like veterinary drugs have increased over the last several years. Our data support the positive relationship between the use of AFS and survival. However, contrary to theoretical predictions (e.g. high and more stable adult survival among long-lived species), the use of AFS increased only survival of pre-adults. Moreover, AFS buffered the effects of illegal poisoning on this age-class, while adult survival decreased over years. Our simulations predicted a maximum value of extinction probability over a time horizon of 50 years. Population projections run with survival rates expected in scenarios without poisoning predicted the situation of least conservation concern, while including only AFS can maintain a large floater surplus that may delay population decline but fails to reduce poisoning risk among adults. Conclusions/Significance Although AFS are not effective to save bearded vultures from an expected population decline, they delay population extinction and can be a useful tool for prolonging population viability while combating illegal and indirect poisoning. The eradication of different sources of poisoning is of top priority to ensure the long-term viability of this and many other species.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Oro","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Margalida","given":"Antoni"},{"family":"Carrete","given":"Martina"},{"family":"Heredia","given":"Rafael"},{"family":"Donázar","given":"José Antonio"}],"container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0004084","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008,12,30]]},"language":"en","page":"e4084","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Testing the Goodness of Supplementary Feeding to Enhance Population Viability in an Endangered Vulture","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0004084","volume":"3"},

We make specific predictions that (a) selection for toxin production depends upon an interplay between the number of bacterial cells that each host ingests and the genetic relatedness between those cells; (b) cheats that do not produce toxin gain an advantage when at low frequencies, and at high bacterial density, allowing them to be maintained in a population alongside toxin-producing cells.

The socioeconomic collective action theory suggests that, in larger groups, the incentives for free riding are stronger, leading to greater inequalities in work division among group members. Here, we use the Gini index to measure inequality at the group level in the contributions of helpers to three different cooperative behaviours (babysitting, pup-provisioning and raised guarding) in groups of varying size in wild Kalahari meerkats (Suricata suricatta). In larger groups, inequality in helpers' contributions to cooperative activities and the frequency of free riding both increased. Elevated levels of inequality were generated partly as a result of increased differences in contributions to cooperative activities between helpers in different sex and age categories in larger groups. After controlling for the positive effect of group size on total provisioning, increasing levels of inequality in contributions were associated with reductions in total pup-provisioning conducted by the group. Reductions in total pup-provisioning were, in turn, associated with reductions in the growth and survival of pups (but pup growth and survival were not directly affected by inequality in provisioning). Our results support the prediction of collective action theory described above and show how the Gini index can be used to investigate the distribution of cooperative behaviour within the group.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Rotics","given":"Shay"},{"family":"Clutton-Brock","given":"Tim"}],"container-title":"Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","DOI":"10.1098/rspb.2020.2104","issue":"1945","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,24]]},"page":"20202104","publisher":"Royal Society","source":"royalsocietypublishing.org (Atypon)","title":"Group size increases inequality in cooperative behaviour","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rspb.2020.2104","volume":"288"},

Studies of cooperative breeding behavior within species have long highlighted the importance of environmental factors in mediating the paradox of why some such individuals delay independent breeding to help raise the offspring of others. In contrast, studies involving comparisons among species have not shown a similarly clear evolutionary-scale relationship between the interspecific incidence of cooperative breeding and any environmental factors. Here, we use a phylogenetically controlled comparative analysis of a complete, socially diverse group of birds-45 species of African starlings-to show that cooperative breeding is positively associated with living in semiarid savanna habitats and with temporal variability in rainfall. Savanna habitats are not only highly seasonal, but also temporally variable and unpredictable, and this temporal variability directly influences individual reproductive decisions in starlings and helps explain interspecific patterns of sociality. Cooperative breeding is likely to be adaptive in temporally variable environments because it allows for both reproduction in harsh years and sustained breeding during benign years. This \"temporal variability\" hypothesis might help explain the phylogenetic and geographic concentrations of cooperatively breeding vertebrates in savanna-like habitats and other temporally variable environments worldwide.","author":[{"family":"Rubenstein","given":"Dustin R."},{"family":"Lovette","given":"Irby J."}],"container-title":"Current biology: CB","container-title-short":"Curr Biol","DOI":"10.1016/j.cub.2007.07.032","ISSN":"0960-9822","issue":"16","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007,8,21]]},"language":"eng","page":"1414-1419","PMID":"17702577","source":"PubMed","title":"Temporal environmental variability drives the evolution of cooperative breeding in birds","type":"article-journal","volume":"17"},

The central notion of this argument, dubbed ‘parochial altruism’, is that the two genetic or cultural traits, aggressiveness against the out-groups and cooperativeness towards the in-group, including self-sacrificial altruistic behaviour, might have coevolved in humans. This review assesses the explanatory power of current theories of ‘parochial altruism’. After a brief synopsis of the existing literature, two pitfalls in the interpretation of the most widely used models are discussed: potential direct benefits and high relatedness between group members implicitly induced by assumptions about conflict structure and frequency. Then, a number of simplifying assumptions made in the construction of these models are pointed out which currently limit their explanatory power. Next, relevant empirical evidence from several disciplines which could guide future theoretical extensions is reviewed.

However, classic competition theory suggests the opposite: that increased competition leads to niche partitioning and greater individual foraging specialisation (‘niche partitioning hypothesis’). We tested these opposing predictions in wild, group-living banded mongooses (Mungos mungo), using stable isotope analysis of banded mongoose whiskers to quantify individual and group foraging niche.

We used a spatial agent-based model to represent mutual cooperation enforced by environmental adversity. We studied two factors, the cost of unreciprocated cooperation and the environmental cost of living, which highlight a conflict between the short- and long-term rewards of cooperation. In the long run, cooperation is favored because only groups with a sufficient number of cooperators will survive. In the short run, however, harsh environmental costs increase the advantage of defectors in cooperator-defector interactions because the loss of resources leads to death. Our analysis sheds new light on the evolution of cooperation via interdependence and illustrates how selfish groups can incur short-term benefits at the cost of their eventual demise. We demonstrate how harsh environments select for cooperative phenotypes and suggest an explanation for the adoption of cooperative breeding strategies in human evolution. We also highlight the importance of variable population size and the role of socio-spatial organization in harsh environments.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Smaldino","given":"Paul E."},{"family":"Schank","given":"Jeffrey C."},{"family":"McElreath","given":"Richard"},{"family":"Sherratt","given":"Associate Editor: Thomas N."},{"family":"Day","given":"Editor: Troy"}],"container-title":"The American Naturalist","DOI":"10.1086/669615","ISSN":"0003-0147","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013]]},"page":"451-463","publisher":"[The University of Chicago Press, The American Society of Naturalists]","source":"JSTOR","title":"Increased Costs of Cooperation Help Cooperators in the Long Run","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/669615","volume":"181"},
  {"id":"strassmannAltruismSocial2000","abstract":"The social amoeba, Dictyostelium discoideum, is widely used as a simple model organism for multicellular development, but its multicellular fruiting stage is really a society. Most of the time, D. discoideum lives as haploid, free-living, amoeboid cells that divide asexually. When starved, 10(4)-10(5) of these cells aggregate into a slug. The anterior 20% of the slug altruistically differentiates into a non-viable stalk, supporting the remaining cells, most of which become viable spores. If aggregating cells come from multiple clones, there should be selection for clones to exploit other clones by contributing less than their proportional share to the sterile stalk. Here we use microsatellite markers to show that different clones collected from a field population readily mix to form chimaeras. Half of the chimaeric mixtures show a clear cheater and victim. Thus, unlike the clonal and highly cooperative development of most multicellular organisms, the development of D. discoideum is partly competitive, with conflicts of interests among cells. These conflicts complicate the use of D. discoideum as a model for some aspects of development, but they make it highly attractive as a model system for social evolution.","author":[{"family":"Strassmann","given":"J.

  {"id":"thompsonCausesConsequences2017","abstract":"Conflict between groups is a notable feature of many animal societies. Recent theoretical models suggest that violent intergroup conflict can shape patterns of within-group cooperation. However, despite its prevalence in social species, the adaptive significance of violent intergroup conflict has been little explored outside of humans and chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes. A barrier to current understanding of the role of intergroup conflict in the evolution of social behaviour is a lack of information on the causes and consequences of aggression between groups. Here, we examined the causes and fitness consequences of intergroup conflict in the banded mongoose, Mungos mungo, using a 16-year data set of observed intergroup interactions, life history and behaviour. Banded mongooses are cooperative breeders that live in highly territorial groups and engage in frequent, aggressive and violent intergroup interactions. We found that intensified population-wide competition for food and mates increased the probability of intergroup interactions, and that increased intergroup conflict was associated with periods in which groups were growing in size. Intergroup conflict had fitness costs in terms of reduced litter and adult survival but no cost to pregnant females: in fact, females were less likely to abort following an intergroup interaction than when there had been no recent intergroup conflict. Our results suggest that intergroup conflict has measurable costs to both individuals and groups in the long and short term, and that levels of conflict among groups could be high enough to affect patterns of within-group cooperative behaviour. Establishing the consequences of intergroup conflict in cooperative species can shed light on patterns of conflict and cooperation within groups and, in turn, facilitate our understanding of social evolution.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Thompson","given":"F.

  {"id":"tilmanEvolutionaryGames2020","abstract":"Strategic interactions arise in all domains of life. This form of competition often plays out in dynamically changing environments. The strategies employed in a population may alter the state of the environment, which may in turn feedback to change the incentive structure of strategic interactions. Feedbacks between strategies and the environment are common in social-ecological systems, evolutionary-ecological systems, and even psychological-economic systems. Here we develop a framework of ‘eco-evolutionary game theory’ that enables the study of strategic and environmental dynamics with feedbacks. We consider environments governed either by intrinsic growth, decay, or tipping points. We show how the joint dynamics of strategies and the environment depend on the incentives for individuals to lead or follow behavioral changes, and on the relative speed of environmental versus strategic change. Our analysis unites dynamical phenomena that occur in settings as diverse as human decision-making, plant nutrient acquisition, and resource harvesting. We discuss implications in fields ranging from ecology to economics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Tilman","given":"Andrew R."},{"family":"Plotkin","given":"Joshua B."},{"family":"Akçay","given":"Erol"}],"container-title":"Nature Communications","container-title-short":"Nat Commun","DOI":"10.1038/s41467-020-14531-6","ISSN":"2041-1723","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,14]]},"language":"en","note":"Bandiera_abtest: a\nCc_license_type: cc_by\nCg_type: Nature Research Journals\nPrimary_atype: Research\nSubject_term: Evolutionary ecology;Evolutionary theory;Social evolution;Theoretical ecology\nSubject_term_id: evolutionary-ecology;evolutionary-theory;social-evolution;theoretical-ecology","number":"1","page":"915","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Evolutionary games with environmental feedbacks","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-14531-6","volume":"11"},

  {"id":"vitikainenLiveLong2019","abstract":"Kin selection theory defines the conditions for which altruism or ‘helping’ can be favoured by natural selection. Tests of this theory in cooperatively breeding animals have focused on the short-term benefits to the recipients of help, such as improved growth or survival to adulthood. However, research on early-life effects suggests that there may be more durable, lifelong fitness impacts to the recipients of help, which in theory should strengthen selection for helping. Here, we show in cooperatively breeding banded mongooses (Mungos mungo) that care received in the first 3 months of life has lifelong fitness benefits for both male and female recipients. In this species, adult helpers called ‘escorts’ form exclusive one-to-one caring relationships with specific pups (not their own offspring), allowing us to isolate the effects of being escorted on later reproduction and survival. Pups that were more closely escorted were heavier at sexual maturity, which was associated with higher lifetime reproductive success for both sexes. Moreover, for female offspring, lifetime reproductive success increased with the level of escorting received per se, over and above any effect on body mass. Our results suggest that early-life social care has durable benefits to offspring of both sexes in this species. Given the well-established developmental effects of early-life care in laboratory animals and humans, we suggest that similar effects are likely to be widespread in social animals more generally. We discuss some of the implications of durable fitness benefits for the evolution of intergenerational helping in cooperative animal societies, including humans.\n\nThis article is part of the theme issue ‘Developing differences: early-life effects and evolutionary medicine’.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Vitikainen","given":"Emma I.

  {"id":"wilsonLethalAggression2014","abstract":"Observations of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and bonobos (Pan paniscus) provide valuable comparative data for understanding the significance of conspecific killing. Two kinds of hypothesis have been proposed. Lethal violence is sometimes concluded to be the result of adaptive strategies, such that killers ultimately gain fit-ness benefits by increasing their access to resources such as food or mates 1–5 . Alternatively, it could be a non-adaptive result of human impacts, such as habitat change or food provisioning 6–9 . To discri-minate between these hypotheses we compiled information from 18 chimpanzee communities and 4 bonobo communities studied over five decades. Our data include 152 killings (n 5 58 observed, 41 inferred, and 53 suspected killings) by chimpanzees in 15 com-munities and one suspected killing by bonobos. We found that males were the most frequent attackers (92% of participants) and victims (73%); most killings (66%) involved intercommunity attacks; and attackers greatly outnumbered their victims (median 8:1 ratio). Variation in killing rates was unrelated to measures of human impacts. Our results are compatible with previously proposed adaptive expla-nations for killing by chimpanzees, whereas the human impact hypo-thesis is not supported.

  {"id":"wranghamEvolutionCoalitionary1999","abstract":"Warfare has traditionally been considered unique to humans. It has, therefore, often been explained as deriving from features that are unique to humans, such as the possession of weapons or the adoption of a patriarchal ideology. Mounting evidence suggests, however, that coalitional killing of adults in neighboring groups also occurs regularly in other species, including wolves and chimpanzees. This implies that selection can favor components of intergroup aggression important to human warfare, including lethal raiding. Here I present the principal adaptive hypothesis for explaining the species distribution of intergroup coalitional killing. This is the “imbalance-of-power hypothesis,” which suggests that coalitional killing is the expression of a drive for dominance over neighbors. Two conditions are proposed to be both necessary and sufficient to account for coalitional killing of neighbors: (1) a state of intergroup hostility; (2) sufficient imbalances of power between parties that one party can attack the other with impunity. Under these conditions, it is suggested, selection favors the tendency to hunt and kill rivals when the costs are sufficiently low. The imbalance-of-power hypothesis has been criticized on a variety of empirical and theoretical grounds which are discussed. To be further tested, studies of the proximate determinants of aggression are needed. However, current evidence supports the hypothesis that selection has favored a hunt-and-kill propensity in chimpanzees and humans, and that coalitional killing has a long history in the evolution of both species.
